        <div><b>What is a Leewaey platform?</b></div>
        <p>
          Leewaey connects individuals or businesses with employed individuals who are available to complete
          short-term or one-time tasks or projects. You can browse and apply for opportunities and communicate
          and collaborate with clients or customers through the platform.
        </p>    
          
        <div><b>How do I find opportunities on Leewaey?</b></div>
        <p>
          Most gig platforms have a search or browse feature that allows users to view available gig opportunities
          based on their location, skills, and other criteria. Users can also set up notifications or alerts to receive
          updates about new gig opportunities that match their interests.
        </p>

        <div><b>How do I get paid for gig work?</b></div>
        <p>
          Gig platforms typically have a payment system in place to facilitate payment between clients and
          freelancers. This may involve the platform holding onto the payment until the gig is completed, and then
          release the payment to the freelancer once the client has approved the work. Some platforms may also
          offer protection or dispute resolution services to help resolve any issues that may arise during the gig.
        </p>

        <div><b>Are gig platforms safe and secure?</b></div>
        <p>
          Most gig platforms take steps to ensure the safety and security of their users, such as implementing
          measures to protect personal and financial information and providing tools for users to communicate
          and collaborate securely. However, it is still important for users to take precautions to protect
          themselves and to carefully evaluate potential clients or gig opportunities before accepting them.
        </p>

        <div><b>What are the benefits of using a gig platform?</b></div>
        <p>
          Gig platforms can provide a convenient and flexible way for individuals to find gig work and earn extra
          income. They can also offer a range of tools and resources to support freelancers and independent
          contractors, such as training and networking opportunities. Gig platforms can also provide businesses
          with access to a pool of talented and skilled professionals who can help them complete tasks or projects
          on a flexible and cost-effective basis.

        <div><b>Is it legal to moonlight?</b></div>
        <p>
          In most cases, it is legal to moonlight as long as it does not interfere with your primary job or violate any
          non-compete agreements or other terms of your employment. However, you should check with your
          employer to see if there are any policies in place regarding moonlighting.
        </p>

        <div><b>Is it ethical to moonlight?</b></div>
        <p>
          Whether or not moonlighting is ethical can depend on the circumstances. Some considerations might
          include whether you have the time and energy to commit to both jobs, whether your moonlighting work
          might create a conflict of interest or appearance of impropriety with your primary job, and whether you
          are being transparent with your employer about your additional work.
        </p>

        <div><b>Do I need to tell my employer that I am moonlighting?</b></div>
        <p>
          It is generally a good idea to be transparent with your employer about any additional work you are
          doing, especially if it could potentially impact your primary job. This allows your employer to make
          informed decisions about your workload and responsibilities.
        </p>


        <div><b>How can I balance the demands of multiple jobs?</b></div>
        <p>
          Balancing the demands of multiple jobs can be challenging, but it is possible with careful planning and
          time management. Some strategies might include setting clear boundaries around your work hours,
          delegating tasks and responsibilities where possible, and being proactive about communication with
          your employers. It is also important to make sure you are getting enough rest and taking care of your
          physical and mental health.
        </p>


        <div><b>What are the potential risks of moonlighting?</b></div>
        <p>
          One risk of moonlighting is that it can lead to burnout if you are taking on too much work. It can also
          create conflicts of interest or raise questions about your loyalty to your primary job if you are working
          for a competing company or in a similar field. Additionally, you may be at risk of violating any non-
          compete agreements or other terms of your employment if you are not careful about the nature of your
          additional work.
